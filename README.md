# My past Kaggle competition notebooks from the Playground Series

Attached to this repositories are the kaggle notebooks that I have created for some of the Playground Series competitions

Out of these 7 competitions, there were two competitions that I was ranked around top 4% and top 10% among 4000 competitors. The first one involved developing a predictive model to help identify at-risk students early using a dataset of 80,000+ student records. Here, I achieved 83.76% accuracy with a stacked ensemble (Tuned XGBoost + LightGBM), ranking in the top 4% (107th/2691) on Kaggle.
More specifically, I applied Optuna for hyperparameter tuning and used 5-fold Stratified K-Fold to ensure model robustness across demographics. The second one involved developing a predictive model to identify people as introverts and extrovers using a dataset of 19,000 samples. Here, I achieved an accuracy of 0.969028, which placed me in the top 10% (473rd/4331) on Kaggle.
